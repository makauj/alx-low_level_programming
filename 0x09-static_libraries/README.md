Static Libraries Learning Project

Welcome to the Static Libraries Learning Project! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn about static libraries in C/C++. Static libraries are a crucial part of software development, allowing us to bundle multiple object files into a single archive file, which can then be linked to other programs.

In this project, I aim to understand the fundamentals of static libraries, including their creation, usage, and benefits. By the end of this project, I hope to have a solid grasp of how to effectively use static libraries in my own projects.

What is a Static Library?
A static library is a collection of object files that are linked into an executable at compile time. Unlike dynamic libraries, static libraries are not shared among programs; each program gets its own copy of the library code.

Why Use Static Libraries?
1. Performance: Static libraries can offer performance benefits as all code is included directly in the executable.
2. Portability: Since the library code is included in the executable, there are no external dependencies to manage.
3. Simplified Deployment: Deployment is easier as there is no need to ensure that the correct version of a shared library is installed on the target system.
